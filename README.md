# TypeScript-Password-Generator

## Description
This project provides multiple types of password generators:  
- **Character-based passwords** using letters, numbers, and symbols.  
- **Word-based readable passwords** using a predefined word list.  
- **Mixed readable passwords** combining words with numbers and symbols.  

The generators are designed to create secure and memorable passwords while demonstrating modular class design in TypeScript.

## Coding Techniques
- TypeScript classes with inheritance and method overriding
- Random selection from arrays using a helper method
- Encapsulation of logic for generating characters, words, and symbols
- Use of a word list for human-readable passwords
- Template literals and string manipulation for password assembly
- Modular code with separate imports and exports (`wordList`)
- Polymorphism: derived classes extend and customize base class behavior

## Example Output
```
Character-based password: gH8!dL2@jK#qW9$eT6^mZ1&
Word-based readable password: astronomy-neutron-artisans-hatless
Mixed readable password: whiskers-7-ventilators-!
```
